Chess engine working in console , implemented in 350 lines of code with chess library in Python
implemented minimax search https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax

Good base for further improvment on engine only lacks endgame tables that could be impemented in the future

command to install library: pip install chess

Lacking gui but terminal interface looks like this:
